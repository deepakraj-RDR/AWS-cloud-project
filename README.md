# DevOps AWS Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on DevOps projects implemented using Amazon Web Services (AWS). Each project focuses on a critical infrastructure setup or configuration task widely used in real-world cloud environments. These projects showcase my understanding of networking, load balancing, auto scaling, and secure file transfer in AWS.
